# Chroma-Keying
A basic chroma keying system using OpenCV to replace green screen backgrounds in video footage.

## Program 1
Enabled user-defined region selection for sampling the green screen and used HSV color statistics with adjustable tolerance via trackbar. Applied morphological operations to refine the mask and composited video frames with a new background image. Output the processed video with real-time preview.
